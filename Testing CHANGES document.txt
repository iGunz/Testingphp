This document is a test to see if Github automatically picks up CHANGES made to documents. For now it will treat it as a new file and will go to the 'uncommitted' section. Admin will need to commit these changes first then it will be uploaded to the github server. This is a clever way to make sure naughty people who are messing around with your code/work are caught and actual damage is nullified.

Basically you can review the work others have done before 'committing' to it. That means you've approved it and its part of the official final product.

Just adding some more thought. I realised that rather than having it all under the 'master' branch I can instead have it under separate branches, each one relating to each test.
